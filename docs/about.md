# About the Code-Maven Live events

At the Code Maven live events hosted by [Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/) you will learn how to use various programming libraries. We focus on Rust, Python, and Perl projects as well as Git/GitHub/GitLab, Docker and Linux in general.

There are various types of events.

* A guest presents a lecture s/he has prepared. (Maybe even given at an in-person event or in some other language.)
* A guest shows us her/his project. (e.g. the guest wrote a crate in Rust and shows us how to use it and maybe also how to contribute to it.) (This can be ad-hoc, after all the guest knows this stuff rather well.)
* A guest teaches us some technique in a rather ad-hoc manner using the concept of pair-programming. e.g. How to use Tauri to build a small application.
* Gabor Szabo, the host presents some topic. (All the old presentations are like this.)

Each event can be up to 1 hour long (with some extra time if needed).


## Introducing your project

If you are introducing a project of you, here are some questions you might want to answer in your presentation.

* Who are you?
* What is your background?
* What do you do?

* What problem does this project solve?
* What did people do before your project?
* How to use your project?
* Why did you write it in Python/Rust/Perl/etc.?
* Why did you write it at all?
* What alternatives are there, in which way is this better?
* Show us your implementation.
* What is missing in your project?
* How can one contribute?
