# About the Code-Maven Live events

At the Code Maven live events hosted by [Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/) you will learn how to use various programming libraries. We focus on Rust, Python, and Perl projects as well as Git/GitHub/GitLab, Docker and Linux in general.

There are various types of events.

* A guest presents a lecture s/he has prepared. (Maybe even given at an in-person event or in some other language.)
* A guest shows us her/his project. (e.g. the guest wrote a crate in Rust and shows us how to use it and maybe also how to contribute to it.) (This can be ad-hoc, after all the guest knows this stuff rather well.)
* A guest teaches us some technique in a rather ad-hoc manner using the pair-programming technique. e.g. How to use Tauri to build a small application.
* Gabor Szabo, the host presents some topic. (All the old presentations are like this.)

---

* Each event has one presentation and thus usually one guest speaker.
* Presentations are usually somewhere between 30-60 long thoght if the topic requires more time we can have a longer session and/or we can have multiple sessions.
* The audience can comment and ask questions via chat.
* After the main session is over and we turn off the recording some people usually stay around and have further discussion. Off the record.

## Introducing your project

If you are introducing a project of you, here are some questions you might want to answer in your presentation.

* Who are you?
* What is your background?
* What do you do?

* What problem does this project solve?
* What did people do before your project?
* How to use your project?
* Why did you write it in Python/Rust/Perl/etc.?
* Why did you write it at all?
* What alternatives are there, in which way is this better?
* Show us your implementation.
* What is missing in your project?
* How can one contribute?

## Pair-programming style sessions

A one-sides pair-programming session in in the driver-navigator style. The host (Gabor Szabo) is the driver who is typing the code in.
The guest is the navigator who knows where we are going and tells the driver what to write.

The navigator wil adjust his/her level of abstraction to the level of understand of the driver. Sometimes it will be enough to
give high-level instructions and let the driver worry about the implementation, sometimes the navigator might need to go into much
more details if the driver does not understand the high-level instructions.

The driver can always ask for clarifications if he does not understand something.

These usually should assume that the person who is writing the code (Gabor) does not know much about the topic and will have questions.
This can create some interesting conversations, but certainly these will help clarify issues.

## Ideas for sessions

* Implement a feature or fix a bug in an open source project. (of the guest or some other project)
* Write a (small?) web application in one of the frameworks.
* Build a TUI, a Terminal User Interface
* Build a GUI, a Graphical User Interface
* Use a 3rd party library (crate in Rust). Any library. (What is the problems to solve? What might be the alternatives?)
* Use a certain database from Rust/Python/Perl. (e.g. SurrealDB, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.
* Build a game.
* How to do Machine Learning?
* How to use LLMs?
