# Creating a command line tool in Rust - Introduction to Rust

One of the nice things about Rust is how easy it is to create command line applications. In this course we are going to learn how to get started to write a simple CLI tool.

* Language: English
* Requirements: Background in programming. You don't need to know Rust for this
* The course will take place even if there is only one student.

What is in this course?

* Live presentation by Gábor Szabó, long time Rust, Perl, and Python trainer, developer, open source contributor.
* Q&A session.
* Hands-on practice with feedback by Gábor.
* Personal help.
* Exclusive and unlimited access to the recordings.
* Fast feedback on your assignments for one week after the session.
* Length: 2-3 hours.
* After the session is over you can keep experimenting and you can get feedback from me on the code you wrote.
* I've scheduled 2 hours in which we'll have presentation and practice, but we might stay for another hour for more practice.
