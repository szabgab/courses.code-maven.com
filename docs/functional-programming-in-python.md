# Functional programming in Python

Python is not a purely functional language, rather it is a multi paradigm language that allows us to write procedural, object oriented and functional style code. It also allows us to mix these styles.
There are several tools in Python that enable us to write code in the functional programming style such as map, filter, list comprehension and more.
In this course we will learn about these tools. Along the presentation you'll also get assignments so you can practice what we learned.

* Language: English.
* Requirements: Basic familiarity with writing Python will be enough.
* The course will take place even if there is only one student.

## What is in this course?

* Live presentation by Gábor Szabó, long time Python trainer, developer, open source contributor.
* Q&A session.
* Hands-on practice with feedback by Gábor.
* Personal help.
* Exclusive and unlimited access to the recordings.
* Fast feedback on your assignments for one week after the session.
* Length: 2-3 hours.
* After the session is over you can keep experimenting and you can get feedback from me on the code you wrote.
* I've scheduled 2 hours in which we'll have presentation and practice, but we might stay for another hour for more practice.
