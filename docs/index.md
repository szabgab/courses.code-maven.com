* Check out the [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/)

* Separate pages for [Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/live), [Python](https://python.code-maven.com/live), and [Perl](https://perlmaven.com/live).

## What is this?

At the Code Maven live events hosted by Gabor Szabo you will learn how to use various programming libraries. We focus on Rust, Python, and Perl projects as well as Git/GitHub/GitLab, Docker and Linux in general.

There are various types of events.

* A guest presents a lecture s/he has prepared. (Maybe even given at an in-person event or in some other language.)
* A guest shows us her/his project. (e.g. the guest wrote a crate in Rust and shows us how to use it and maybe also how to contribute to it.) (This can be ad-hoc, after all the guest knows this stuff rather well.)
* A guest teaches us some technique in a rather ad-hoc manner. e.g. How to use Tauri to build a small application.
* Gabor Szabo, the host presents some topic. (All the old presentations are like this.)

Each event can be up to 1 hour long (with some extra time if needed).
