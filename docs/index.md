# Code-Maven Live courses

## What do you get in a course?

* Live presentation by [Gábor Szabó](https://szabgab.com/) long time Perl, Python, and Rust trainer, developer and Open Source contributor.
* Q&A session.
* Hands-on practice with feedback by Gábor.
* Personal help.
* Fast feedback on your assignments for one week after the session.
* Exclusive and unlimited access to the recordings of the presentation.

* After the session is over you can keep experimenting and you can get feedback from me on the code you wrote.
* I've scheduled 2 hours in which we'll have presentation and practice, but we might stay for another hour for more practice.
