# Classical OOP - Object Oriented Perl

In this course we are going to learn how to write Object Oriented code in Perl using the classical OOP system. It is extremely useful both for writing new applications and to maintain existing code-bases that are written in an Object Oriented style.

## What is in such a course?

* Live presentation by Gábor Szabó, long time Perl trainer, developer, open source contributor.
* Q&A session.
* Hands-on practice with feedback by Gábor.
* Personal help.
* Exclusive and unlimited access to the recordings.
* Fast feedback on your assignments for one week after the session.
* Length: 2-3 hours.

* After the session is over you can keep experimenting and you can get feedback from me on the code you wrote.
* I've scheduled 2 hours in which we'll have presentation and practice. We might stay for another hour for more practice.
